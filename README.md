# FinFET_7nm-Circuit-Design-Characterization
This workshop builds professional FinFET skills on **ASAP7 (7 nm)** using **Xschem/Ngspice** and open repositories. You’ll characterise **NFET/PFET** (Id–Vd, gm, ro), size an inverter, extract **VTC/noise margins**, and automate measure scripts. Next, simulate a **Self-Cascode MOS bandgap**, reproducing **Vref, line/load regulation**, and **temperature drift** with instructor decks. Run deterministic PVT sweeps and produce benchmarked, publication-ready plots. Graduated with a **validated 7 nm workflow** and a portfolio ready for advanced-node.
