# FinFET_7nm-Circuit-Design-Characterization
FinFET Circuit Design and Characterization is a hands-on workshop using the ASAP7 (7 nm) platform with Xschem, Ngspice, and BSIM-CMG models. You will characterize devices, design an inverter, analyze VTC and noise margins, and build a bandgap reference with guided labs, sweeps, and documentation to develop strong advanced-node design skills.
