**Bandgap Reference Voltage**

- A Bandgap Reference Voltage (Vref) is a temperature-independent, stable DC voltage generated by a special analog circuit called a bandgap reference circuit. For silicon-based ICs, this reference voltage is typically around: 𝑉ref≈1.2V 
- The reason for 1.2v is the bandgap energy of silicon is approximately 1.12 eV at room temperature (~27 °C). By designing the circuit carefully, we generate a voltage proportional to this energy, giving us a nearly constant Vref across temperature, supply, and process variations.
- When we integrate a Self-Biased Current Mirror (SBCM), the circuit becomes more stable and self-regulating.

The following is the reference circuit:

| Feature | Traditional Bandgap | Bandgap with SBCM     |
| :--------  | :----------- |:------------------- |	
| Bias current	| External	| Self-generated |
| Power efficiency	| Lower	| Higher |
| Startup mechanism	| Needs manual circuit |	Built-in startup |
| Process variation |	More sensitive	| Better compensated |
| Chip area |	Larger	| Can be optimized |

Almost every SoC, CPU, GPU, RFIC, and analog IC has at least one bandgap reference because:

- ADCs & DACs → Need stable reference voltage.
- PLLs & clock generators → Require precise voltage.
- Power management → LDOs & regulators need it.
- Sensors → Temperature, pressure, and optical sensors rely on it.

| Full Form            | Complementary to Absolute Temperature          | Proportional to Absolute Temperature           |
| Temperature Behavior | Voltage **decreases** as temperature increases | Voltage **increases** as temperature increases |
| Nature               | Negative temperature coefficient               | Positive temperature coefficient               |
| Typical Example      | BJT base–emitter voltage (**VBE**)             | Thermal voltage (**VT = kT/q**), ΔVBE          |
| Mathematical Trend   | VBE ≈ –2 mV/°C                                 | VT ∝ T                                         |
| Source               | Single BJT or diode                            | Two BJTs with different current densities      |
| Used In              | Bandgap references, temperature sensors        | Bandgap references, bias generators            |
| Role in Bandgap      | Provides **CTAT slope**                        | Provides **PTAT slope**                        |
| Alone Behavior       | Temperature dependent                          | Temperature dependent                          |
| Combined Effect      | CTAT + PTAT → **Temperature-stable voltage**   | CTAT + PTAT → **Temperature-stable voltage**   |

The key idea is to combine two opposing temperature effects:

Source Type of Voltage Temperature Behavior Base–emitter voltage (VBE) of a BJT CTAT (Complementary to Absolute Temperature) Decreases as temperature rises Thermal voltage (VT = kT/q) PTAT (Proportional to Absolute Temperature) Increases as temperature rises

By adding a scaled PTAT voltage to a CTAT voltage: VREF = VBE + kVT

The temperature dependencies cancel each other out, yielding an approximately constant voltage ≈ 1.205 V (the silicon bandgap at 0 K).

**Quick Memory Trick**

CTAT → Cold ↑ Voltage ↑ → Hot ↑ Voltage ↓

PTAT → Cold ↓ Voltage ↓ → Hot ↑ Voltage ↑


Bandgap Reference Equation (Recall)


VBE → CTAT

ΔVBE → PTAT

Choose K correctly → flat VREF (~1.2 V)
