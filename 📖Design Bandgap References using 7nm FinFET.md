**Bandgap Reference Voltage**

- A Bandgap Reference Voltage (Vref) is a temperature-independent, stable DC voltage generated by a special analog circuit called a bandgap reference circuit. For silicon-based ICs, this reference voltage is typically around: 𝑉ref≈1.2V 
- The reason for 1.2v is the bandgap energy of silicon is approximately 1.12 eV at room temperature (~27 °C). By designing the circuit carefully, we generate a voltage proportional to this energy, giving us a nearly constant Vref across temperature, supply, and process variations.
- When we integrate a Self-Biased Current Mirror (SBCM), the circuit becomes more stable and self-regulating.

The following is the reference circuit:

| Feature | Traditional Bandgap | Bandgap with SBCM     |
| :--------  | :----------- |:------------------- |	
| Bias current	| External	| Self-generated |
| Power efficiency	| Lower	| Higher |
| Startup mechanism	| Needs manual circuit |	Built-in startup |
| Process variation |	More sensitive	| Better compensated |
| Chip area |	Larger	| Can be optimized |

Almost every SoC, CPU, GPU, RFIC, and analog IC has at least one bandgap reference because:

- ADCs & DACs → Need stable reference voltage.
- PLLs & clock generators → Require precise voltage.
- Power management → LDOs & regulators need it.
- Sensors → Temperature, pressure, and optical sensors rely on it.
